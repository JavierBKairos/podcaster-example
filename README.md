# Podcaster

Podcaster is a small React application for Top100 podcast viewing from iTunes.

## Installation

Using NPM:

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

We can use the following command to start the application in development mode (without minification fo assets):

```bash
npm run start:dev
```

In the case of starting the application in production mode, if we do not have "serve" installed:

```bash
npm install -g serve
```

With "serve", we can start the application in productive mode:

```bash
npm run start:pro
```

## Test

We can run Jest tests:

```bash
npm run test
```
